                <h6>Current Asset</h6>
                <p id="as1">In this asset class, you would include things that can be easily converted into cash. Examples of assets in this category include stock holdings, inventory, short-term investments, marketable securities, fixed deposits, the balance in
                    your business’s checking and savings accounts, bills receivable, and prepaid expenses. Because this type of asset can be quickly turned into cash, it’s also often termed “liquid assets.”</p>
                <h6>Fixed Asset</h6>
                <p id="as2">Also known as long-term assets or non-current assets, these are things that are of a fixed nature because they cannot be easily converted into cash and often require complex procedures and a significant amount of time before you can have
                    their cash value in hand. For instance, fixed assets would encompass things like land, real estate, machinery and equipment, and furniture.</p>

                <p id="as3">As the name implies, tangible assets are those assets that you can see and touch. This can include items that may also be referred to as current or fixed assets. For instance, cash — a current asset — is a tangible asset because it’s something
                    you can physically touch. Most fixed assets are also tangible assets for the same reason. Land, real estate, machinery, equipment, and furniture are, after all, things you can see and touch.</p>
